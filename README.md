## Practical Front-End Projects with Pure Javascript, and a bit of both CSS, and HTML
This project is the frontend part of Backend-electionSystem where I ahve built using Java, Spring Framework, JPA, Hibernate backed by MySQL DB.


The frontend part was mainly to showcase the DOM manipulation, traversal, usage of Array methods such as 'map' 
and hwo to retrieve data from spring Boot Rest APIs by leveraging the powerful and efficient FETCH API.
